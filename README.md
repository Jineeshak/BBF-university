## Curriculum
### Classes for Researchers
Bug bounty programs are set up by organisations to encourage individuals to report potential security issues. When it comes to becoming a <i>bug bounty hunter</i>, we think the team at HackerOne put it well:

<blockquote>
Anyone with computer skills and a high degree of curiosity can become a successful finder of vulnerabilities [...] the main requirement is that you need to keep learning continuously.
</blockquote>

These BBF University classes introduce you to bug bounty hunting, and aim to provide a stable footing as you write your first bug reports. By the end of the course, we hope you will have familiarised yourself with...

* a wide range of vulnerability classes
* which types of bug to report (and which <i>not</i> to report)
* how to compose an effective, well-received a vulnerability report.

### Classes for Program Operators
These classes revolve around launching, maintaining, and evolving a successful bug bounty program. we will try to explain when you should consider fixing a vulnerability and when not. Also, a checklist of vulnerabilities you can resolve before launching a bug bounty program.
