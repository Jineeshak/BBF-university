## Curriculum
### Classes for Researchers
Bug bounty programs are set up by organisations to encourage individuals to report potential security issues. When it comes to becoming a <i>bug bounty hunter</i>, we think the team at <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/become-a-successful-bug-bounty-hunter">HackerOne</a> put it well:

<blockquote>
Anyone with computer skills and a high degree of curiosity can become a successful finder of vulnerabilities [...] the main requirement is that you need to keep learning continuously.
</blockquote>

These BBF University classes introduce you to bug bounty hunting, and aim to provide a stable footing as you write your first bug reports.

By the end of the course, we hope you will have familiarised yourself with...

* a wide range of vulnerability classes
* which types of bug to report (and which <i>not</i> to report)
* how to compose a descriptive, well-received vulnerability report
* how to communicate respectfully and effectively with security teams.

### Classes for Program Operators
Organising a bug bounty program may feel like a daunting endeavour. These BBF University classes aim to establish an effective baseline strategy to help you launch, maintain, and evolve a successful bug bounty disclosure program.

By the end of the course, we hope you will have familiarised yourself with...

* how to process, triage, and action reports effectively
* how to promote positive researcher interactions
* when you should consider fixing a vulnerability and when not
* a checklist of vulnerabilities you can resolve before launching a program.
